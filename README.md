# RatGain_Hackathon
My approach

Step 1: Analyzed RatGain website and problem statement

Step 2: Try to fetch the web content using request
      Problem: Company applied some security due to which i failed to fetch the web content.
      Next try: Trick with website by asking the web content from virtual User Agent as Mozilla
      Result: Wolla! it works and i was able to fetch the content.
      
Step 3: 
      Problem: Since fetching the web again and again may block me so i need to do something now.What to be Done
      My approach: Just fetch the code once and store it in a txt file.
      Result: I don't need to fetch the web again and again.
      
Step 4: I have the web but what to do next???
      Let's analyze the code.
      
Step 5: 
      Problem: Code is messy
      My approach: Let's create a html file and use prettier tool to understand the code more easily.
      Result: Now i am able to understand the code easily.
      
Step 6: Use the Python's BeautifulSoup Library and used my experience to target the right points.
      Result: That's cool as i was able to match many info from that.
      
Step 7: Store this into a csv

Step 8: Check whether it needs to be filtered?
      Result: It's sad to see that the data is not that much messy. I was expecting more challenge from Ratgain.
      
Step 9: 
      Problem: It has 45 pages from 1 to 45 
      My approach: Let's apply a loop, get the data from easy page filtering the data which iu require and appending it with a global variable.
      OOPS!!! Website is detecting lots of traffic from my end and is not fulfilling my request to give web.
      My approach: Let's ask the data from website with a delay of 2 seconds.
      Result: Idea worked and i get the whole data within few mins
      
Step 10: Let's make the code more cool such that every coder fall in love with that code.

MISSION SUCCESSFUL
